    <h1>Database System Information</h1>

    <h2>Database System</h2>
    <p>A database system consists of a collection of interrelated data and a set of application programs to access, update and manage the data.</p>

    <h2>Database</h2>
    <p>It is organized form of record about some person, organization or something stored under certain media.</p>
    <p>It is a collection of related information about a subject organized in a useful manner that provides a base or foundation for procedures, such as retrieving information, drawing conclusions, and making decisions.</p>

    <h2>Advantages of Database over Flat File or File-based System</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduction of data redundancies</li>
        <li>Shared data</li>
        <li>Data independence</li>
        <li>Improved integrity</li>
        <li>Efficient data access</li>
        <li>Multiple user interface</li>
        <li>Improved security</li>
        <li>Improved backup and recovery</li>
        <li>Supports for concurrent transactions</li>
        <li>Unforeseen queries can be answered</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DBMS (Database Management System)</h2>
    <p>A Database Management System is software that manages the data stored in a database. This is a collection of software used to store data, records, process them, and obtain desired information. Since data are very important to the end users, we must have a good way of managing data.</p>
    <p>A DBMS is a collection of programs that manage the database structure and control access to the data stored in the database. The DBMS makes it possible to share the data in the database among multiple applications or users. The DBMS stands between the database and the user.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> MS-Access, Oracle, FoxPro, dBase, SQL Server, MySQL, Delphi, Sybase, etc.</p>

    <h2>Basic Terms</h2>
    <h3>Field/Attribute</h3>
    <p>A field is a piece of information about an element. A field is represented by a column. Every field has got a title called the field title.</p>

    <h3>Record (Tuple)</h3>
    <p>A record is information about an element such as a person, student, employee, client, etc. A record can have much information in different headings or titles.</p>

    <h3>Table</h3>
    <p>A table is the arrangement of rows and columns. Each table must have a unique name and must be simple. It is the place where data and information are stored.</p>

    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>Database Objects are the essential tools of a relational database. These database objects help to store, view, edit, and manipulate the data and information stored in the database.</p>
    <p>It can be used to hold and manipulate the data. Some of the examples of database objects are views, sequences, indexes, forms, queries, reports, etc.</p>

    <h2>Database Objects</h2>
